# Competitor Alternatives: Shastrarthi vs Generic AI

## Strategy
Position Shastrarthi not just as "another AI wrapper" but as a **Specialized Research Tool** for serious seekers. Highlight the risks of using generic LLMs for spiritual study (fabrication, lack of context).

## Target Keyword
"Best AI for Hindu scriptures", "ChatGPT for Sanskrit", "Shastrarthi vs ChatGPT"

**Subhead:** "Why serious seekers choose Shastrarthi over generic assistants like ChatGPT."

### 2. The Core Problem
- **Generic AI**: Trained on the whole internet (reddit, blogs, misinformation).
