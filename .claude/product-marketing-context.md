# Product Marketing Context

*Last updated: 2026-02-12*

## Product Overview
**One-liner:** AI-powered research companion for ancient Sanskrit texts
**What it does:** Shastrarthi lets users read Sanskrit texts verse-by-verse (Sanskrit, transliteration, English), ask an AI trained on Dharmic traditions to explain any concept, compare interpretations across lineages (Advaita, Shaiva, Bhakti, etc.), and build a structured personal study library with notes, bookmarks, and reading progress.
**Product category:** AI study tool / Sanskrit research platform / ancient text reader
**Product type:** SaaS (web application)
**Business model:** Freemium -- core reading and AI explanations free, premium features for advanced research, deep study modes, and export

## Target Audience
**Target users:**
- Sanskrit and philosophy students (university and self-directed)
- Spiritual seekers studying Dharmic traditions
- Yoga practitioners exploring foundational texts (Yoga Sutras, Hatha Yoga Pradipika)
- Academic researchers in Indology, Religious Studies, South Asian Studies
- Dharmic tradition practitioners (Advaita, Shaiva, Shakta, Vaishnavism)
- Yoga teacher training participants and teachers

**Decision-makers:** Individual users (B2C). Secondary: university departments, yoga schools, spiritual organizations

**Primary use case:** Understanding a specific verse or concept from a Shastra with contextual, tradition-aware explanations

**Jobs to be done:**
- "I want to understand what this verse actually means, with context I can trust"
- "I want to research a concept (like Dharma or Moksha) across multiple texts"
- "I want to compare how different traditions interpret the same teaching"
- "I want a structured study path so I know what to read and in what order"
- "I want to keep my notes, bookmarks, and progress in one place"

**Use cases:**
- Verse-level study: Read one verse, ask the AI to explain, get multi-tradition context
- Cross-text research: Search a concept and see how it appears across Vedas, Upanishads, Gita, Yoga Sutras
- Tradition comparison: See how Advaita reads a verse vs. Shaiva vs. Bhakti interpretation
- Study path creation: Get a curated sequence of texts based on level and goals
- Academic research: Build notebooks with structured notes and citations for papers

## Problems & Pain Points
**Core problem:** Studying Shastras today is fragmented, inaccessible, and overwhelming. Texts are scattered across PDFs, out-of-print books, and static websites with no interactivity. Translations lack context. Commentary requires buying expensive books. There's no way to ask questions, compare traditions, or keep organized notes -- all in one place.

**Why alternatives fall short:**
- sacred-texts.com: Static HTML from the early 2000s, no interactivity, translations are often Victorian-era
- Wisdom Library: Reference-only, no AI, no study tools, no verse-level interaction
- Vedabase: Single-tradition (Gaudiya Vaishnava), not multi-tradition
- Gita Supersite: Only Bhagavad Gita, limited to one text, no AI
- Physical books: Expensive, hard to cross-reference, no search, no structured note-taking
- ChatGPT/general AI: No curated text corpus, hallucinates Sanskrit, no verse-level grounding, no tradition-specific accuracy

**What it costs them:**
- Hours searching for a single verse across multiple sources
- Confusion from translations without tradition context
- No way to organize study across multiple texts
- Missing connections between related concepts across Shastras

**Emotional tension:** Frustration ("I can't find a reliable explanation"), overwhelm ("Where do I even start?"), doubt ("Is this translation accurate? Which tradition is this from?"), isolation ("I'm studying alone with no guidance")

## Competitive Landscape
**Direct competitors:**
- Gita Supersite -- falls short because it covers only the Bhagavad Gita, no AI, no multi-text research
- Vedabase -- falls short because it's single-tradition (ISKCON), not scholarly multi-tradition

**Secondary competitors:**
- General AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) -- fall short because they lack a curated Sanskrit corpus, hallucinate terminology, and have no verse-level grounding or tradition awareness
- Online Sanskrit dictionaries (Monier-Williams, Spokensanskrit) -- fall short because they provide words, not understanding

**Indirect competitors:**
- Physical books and commentaries -- fall short because they're expensive, not searchable, single-tradition, and can't be cross-referenced easily
- University courses -- fall short because they're expensive, time-bound, geographically limited
- YouTube explainers -- fall short because they're unstructured, hard to reference, quality varies wildly

## Differentiation
**Key differentiators:**
- AI explanations grounded in actual verse text (not hallucinated)
- Multi-tradition interpretation comparison (Advaita, Shaiva, Shakta, Bhakti, Dvaita, Vishishtadvaita)
- Verse-by-verse reading with Sanskrit, transliteration, and English in one view
- Interactive Q&A on any verse -- ask follow-up questions, get contextual answers
- Structured study tools (bookmarks, notes, notebooks, reading progress)
- 10+ sacred texts in one platform (Vedas, Upanishads, Gita, Yoga Sutras, Tantra, Puranas)

**How we do it differently:** We combine a curated corpus of actual Sanskrit texts with an AI trained to respect tradition boundaries -- it tells you what Advaita says vs. what Shaiva says, rather than blending them into a generic answer.

**Why that's better:** Students get accurate, tradition-aware understanding instead of decontextualized translations or AI hallucinations.

**Why users would choose us:** Only platform that combines interactive AI with multi-tradition verse-level study across multiple Shastras.

## Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Can I trust AI with sacred texts?" | The AI is grounded in actual verse text and cites tradition-specific sources. It doesn't make things up -- it explains what the texts say. |
| "I prefer learning from a guru/teacher" | Shastrarthi complements a teacher, not replaces one. Use it to prepare questions, review verses, and deepen study between sessions. |
| "Free tools already exist" | Existing tools are static and single-tradition. Shastrarthi lets you ask questions, compare traditions, and organize your study -- none of them do that. |

**Anti-persona:** Someone looking for devotional practice guidance (we're a research/study tool, not a spiritual counselor). Someone wanting only one tradition's perspective with no interest in comparison.

## Switching Dynamics
**Push:** Frustrated with scattered PDFs, unreliable translations, and no way to ask questions about what they're reading
**Pull:** Interactive AI that explains verses in context, multi-tradition comparison, organized study workspace
**Habit:** "I've always used books" or "I just Google it" -- low switching cost since current approaches are frustrating
**Anxiety:** "Will the AI be accurate?" "Is this respectful to the traditions?" "Will my data be safe?"

## Customer Language
**How they describe the problem:**
- "I can never find a good translation with commentary"
- "I don't know which tradition this interpretation is from"
- "I wish I could just ask someone what this verse means"
- "There's no good way to study multiple texts together"
- "I spend hours searching for one verse across different sites"

**How they describe what they want:**
- "A study companion that actually knows the texts"
- "Something like having a knowledgeable friend who studied Sanskrit"
- "A way to see how different schools read the same verse"
- "An organized place for all my Shastra study"

**Words to use:** Shastra, verse, text, tradition, lineage, study, research, explore, understand, practice, wisdom, Sanskrit, commentary, interpretation
**Words to avoid:** Digitize, disrupt, revolutionize, synergy, leverage, cutting-edge, AI-powered (overused), gamify, monetize
