# Product Marketing Context

*Last updated: 2026-02-14*

## Product Overview
**One-liner:** A research platform for ancient Sanskrit texts with AI-powered explanations.
**What it does:** Shastrarthi provides access to sacred texts (Shastras) with integrated AI personas (Gurus) that offer lineage-based explanations, translations, and etymological breakdowns, bridging the gap between ancient wisdom and modern understanding.
**Product category:** Education Technology / Spiritual Tech
**Product type:** SaaS (likely Freemium considering "pricing" mentioned in nav)
**Business model:** Freemium / Subscription

## Target Audience
**Target companies:** N/A (B2C Focus)
**Decision-makers:** Individual Seekers, Students, Scholars
**Primary use case:** Deep study and understanding of ancient Indian texts without needing to be a Sanskrit expert.
**Jobs to be done:**
- Understand complex spiritual concepts without a physical guru.
- Verify Sanskrit translations and meanings.
- Compare interpretations across different schools (Advaita, Yoga, Tantra).
**Use cases:**
- A yoga practitioner wanting to understand the Yoga Sutras deeper than a studio class.
- A student of Vedanta trying to parse Shankaracharya's commentaries.
- A curious individual exploring the Bhagavad Gita for life advice.

## Personas
| Persona | Cares about | Challenge | Value we promise |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| **The Seeker** | Personal growth, spiritual insight | Texts are too dense/esoteric; lacks a teacher | Accessible, lineage-authentic guidance for life application. |
| **The Scholar/Student** | Accuracy, original Sanskrit, references | Finding specific verses, cross-referencing, translation verification | precise tools, etymology, and authentic source citations. |
| **The Devotee** | Connection to tradition, reverence | Modern translations feel dry or academic; AI feels "soulless" | A respectful, "Sadhaka-centric" interface that honors the tradition. |

## Problems & Pain Points
**Core problem:** Ancient Indian texts are inaccessible due to language barriers (Sanskrit) and lack of context, while finding a qualified human teacher is difficult.
**Why alternatives fall short:**
- **Google/Generic AI:** Hallucinates, lacks reverence, gives shallow "Wikipedia-style" answers.
- **Books/PDFs:** Static, hard to search, no interactive Q&A.
- **Traditional Gurus:** Hard to access geographically or restrictively sectarian.
**What it costs them:** Time spent searching, confusion from bad translations, spiritual bypass.
**Emotional tension:** Fear of misunderstanding invalidating their practice; frustration with "gatekeeping" of knowledge.

## Competitive Landscape
**Direct:** **Vedabase.io** (Static, ISKCON specific), **WisdomLib** (cluttered, hard to read).
**Secondary:** **ChatGPT/Claude** (Generic AI) — falls short because it lacks specific training on lineages and can fabricate verses.
**Indirect:** **Traditional Ashrams/Courses** — high commitment, expensive.

## Differentiation
**Key differentiators:**
- **AI Personas (Gurus):** Specialized modes for Advaita, Yoga, Tantra, etc. (not one-size-fits-all).
- **Lineage Fidelity:** Prompts are engineered to reflect specific schools of thought (e.g., Shankara for Advaita).
- **Sanskrit Etymology:** Built-in tools to break down words (dhatu/root analysis).
**How we do it differently:** We don't just "chat"; we "contextualize" based on the specific text and tradition.
**Why that's better:** Users get fewer hallucinations and more culturally/philosophically accurate answers.
**Why customers choose us:** For the depth and authenticity that generic tools lack.

## Objections
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Can AI really teach spirituality?" | It acts as a *Shastrarthi* (study partner), not a Guru replacer. It helps with intellectual clarity (*Manana*). |
| "Is the Sanskrit accurate?" | We use specialized models and cross-reference with established dictionaries. |
| "Is this biased?" | We offer multiple persona modes so you can see the text through different lenses (Advaita, Dualist, etc.). |

**Anti-persona:** The "New Age" seeker looking for "manifestation" hacks without respecting the source material.

## Switching Dynamics
**Push:** Frustration with ChatGPT making up verses; being overwhelmed by dense PDFs.
**Pull:** The promise of having a "Guru in your pocket" for intellectual study.
**Habit:** Googling "meaning of [verse]".
**Anxiety:** "Will I get bad karma from wrong interpretation?" ( mitigated by our "boundaries" in prompts).

## Customer Language
**How they describe the problem:**
- "I can't read Sanskrit."
- "The commentary is too hard to understand."
- "I don't know which translation is right."
**How they describe us:**
- "Like ChatGPT for Hindu scriptures."
- "A digital pandit."
**Words to use:** Shastra, Sadhaka, Verse, Commentary, Lineage, Insight, Context.
**Words to avoid:** "Content", "User", "App" (use "Platform" or "Space"), "AI God".

## Brand Voice
**Tone:** Reverent, Scholarly, Accessible, Calm.
**Style:** structured, precise, but encouraging.
**Personality:** The wise librarian or the helpful senior student.
